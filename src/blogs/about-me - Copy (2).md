# More About Me

Hey 👋 I'm Ali Anas Joshan.

This is the story behind my journey into tech.

## 🌱 How It Started

I didn’t just wake up one day wanting to code.  
It started with curiosity — how do websites actually work?

After discovering programming, I realized something:

> Coding isn’t about writing syntax.  
> It’s about solving problems.

## 💡 The Turning Point

Taking CS50 completely changed how I think about problems.
It taught me:
- Breaking problems into smaller pieces
- Thinking algorithmically
- Debugging logically instead of emotionally

## 🚀 Where I’m Headed

I’m currently focused on:
- Front-end engineering (React ecosystem)
- Writing clean, scalable code
- Building projects in public
- Improving system design fundamentals

This blog will document everything I learn along the way.

Thanks for reading 🤝
