# More About Me

My name is **Ali Anas Joshan**, a software engineering learner based in Kabul, Afghanistan. I am currently a Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) student at Moraa University, in my second semester, while also pursuing intensive self-directed technical training.

This page documents the early chapter of my journey into technology — how it started, what shaped my thinking, and where I am heading.

## How It Started

My interest in technology began with a persistent question:

**How do complex systems actually work under the hood?**

I wasn’t satisfied with simply using applications. I wanted to understand how they were built — how data moves, how algorithms operate, how systems scale, and how architecture decisions shape performance and reliability.

Curiosity turned into structured learning.

## The First Milestone

My first major milestone came in September of 2025 when I completed Harvard’s CS50: Introduction to Computer Science and the Art of Programming.

The course was intense and transformative. Through C, Python, algorithms, data structures, memory management, and foundational web development, I worked through rigorous problem sets and built real projects that required disciplined problem-solving.

Earning the certificate was more than an academic accomplishment. It proved that I could teach myself difficult concepts and operate in a demanding technical environment.

More importantly, CS50 didn’t just teach syntax — it trained me to think like an engineer:
- Breaking complex problems into manageable components  
- Approaching debugging logically and systematically  
- Designing structured solutions step by step  

That experience shifted my mindset from curiosity to commitment.

## Moving Into Software Engineering

After CS50, I deliberately moved deeper into software engineering through web development.

The web is one of the most powerful platforms for building scalable products and delivering solutions globally. Mastering both front-end and back-end systems allows me to understand software holistically — not just as isolated code, but as architecture, performance, and user experience combined.

My goal is not simply to become “a developer.”  
My goal is to build products and services that solve meaningful, real-world problems.

I am currently focused on:
- Strengthening front-end engineering skills (React ecosystem)  
- Building full-stack capabilities  
- Writing clean, scalable, maintainable code  
- Improving system design fundamentals  

Every project I build is part of a long-term strategy: developing technical depth, execution discipline, and architectural thinking.

## Looking Forward

This is still the early chapter of my story. There will be setbacks, pivots, and challenges — and that is expected. Growth in engineering is nonlinear.

What matters is consistency, structured learning, and relentless iteration.

If you are reading this, thank you for taking the time to understand my journey. I value thoughtful conversations, constructive feedback, and shared experiences.

I am building with intention — and this is only the beginning.
